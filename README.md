# Obsidian Vault Template for Graduate Students

This template originated from my work on managing gradschool work using Obsidian and GitHub.

## Structure

This vault is organized in the following way:
```
.
├── 1_templates
   └── useful templates and prompts
├── 2_guides
│   ├── Obsidian - Markdown.md
│   ├── Obsidian - Properties (front matter).md
│   ├── Obsidian - Tags.md
│   ├── Obsidian - Tips.md
│   └── Writing - Effective Summaries of Research Articles.md
├── 3_topics
│   └── Some topics to get you started
├── 4_sources
├── 5_notes
   └── Example - Note.md
├── README.md
└── to-do.md
```

I recommend taking a look at the gides.

If you subscribe to the chunk writing method, you might want to add a new folder called `0_chunks`. Once you have enough chunks about a certain topic you can then convert them into a note and move it into `5_notes`.
