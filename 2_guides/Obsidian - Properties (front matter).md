"Properties allow you to organize information about a note. Properties contain structured data such as text, links, dates, checkboxes, and numbers. Properties can also be used in combination with [Community plugins](https://help.obsidian.md/Extending+Obsidian/Community+plugins) that can do useful things with your structured data." https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Properties


The properties I use are the following. You can copy and paste them at the beginning of a note (right below the name) and Obsidian will automatically convert the code below into a Properties table.
